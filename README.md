# Deployment of GUVI GPT Model using Hugging Face

## Project Overview

This project involves deploying a fine-tuned GPT model, trained on GUVI’s company data, using Hugging Face services. The goal is to create a scalable and secure web application using Streamlit or Gradio, making the model accessible to users over the internet. The deployment leverages Hugging Face spaces resources and a database to store usernames and login times.

## Problem Statement

Deploy a fine-tuned GPT model using Hugging Face services and create a web application with Streamlit or Gradio to make it accessible online.

### Business Use Cases

1. **Customer Support Automation:** Automate responses to FAQs, reducing workload and improving response times.
2. **Content Generation for Marketing:** Generate marketing content like blog posts and social media updates.
3. **Educational Assistance for Students:** Act as a virtual teaching assistant for student queries.
4. **Internal Knowledge Base:** Enable employees to quickly access company-related information.
5. **Training and Onboarding:** Provide new employees with instant access to training materials and company information.

## Approach

### Data Preparation

1. **Data Collection:** Gather text data from various sources within GUVI.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess the text data (e.g., remove special characters, normalize text).
3. **Tokenization:** Convert text data into tokens using the GPT-2 tokenizer.
4. **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the prepared dataset using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

### Infrastructure Setup

1. **Data Storage:** Store the app.py file and necessary files in an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. **Launch EC2 Instance:** Set up an Amazon EC2 instance with appropriate IAM roles and security groups.
3. **Environment Setup:** Install required packages (Streamlit, Boto3, transformers, torch) and download the app.py file from S3.
4. **Deploy Application:** Run the Streamlit application on the EC2 instance.
5. **Security:** Configure a security group to allow inbound traffic on the app’s port.

## Project Deliverables

- **Source Code:** Complete source code for the Streamlit application.
- **Documentation:** Detailed setup instructions and usage guide.
- **Deployment Scripts:** Scripts for environment setup and application deployment.
- **Project Report:** Summary of the project, approach, and results.

## Project Evaluation Metrics

- **Functionality:** Correctly loads the model and generates coherent responses.
- **Performance:** Responds to user queries within an acceptable time frame.
- **Scalability:** Handles multiple users concurrently.
- **Security:** Implements proper security measures.
- **Usability:** User-friendly and intuitive interface.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
