# Deployment of GUVI GPT-2 Model using Hugging Face

## Project Overview

This project involves deploying a fine-tuned GPT-2 model, trained on GUVI-specific data, using Hugging Face services. The goal is to create a scalable and secure web application using Streamlit, making the model accessible to users over the internet. The deployment leverages Hugging Face Spaces resources and a database to store usernames and login times.

## Problem Statement

Deploy a fine-tuned GPT-2 model using Hugging Face services and create a web application with Streamlit to make it accessible online.

### Business Use Cases

1. **Customer Support Automation:** Automate responses to FAQs, reducing workload and improving response times.
2. **Content Generation for Marketing:** Generate marketing content like blog posts and social media updates.
3. **Educational Assistance for Students:** Act as a virtual teaching assistant for student queries.
4. **Internal Knowledge Base:** Enable employees to quickly access company-related information.
5. **Training and Onboarding:** Provide new employees with instant access to training materials and company information.

## Approach

### Data Preparation

1. **Data Collection:** Gather text data from various sources within GUVI.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess the text data (e.g., remove special characters, normalize text).
3. **Tokenization:** Convert text data into tokens using the GPT-2 tokenizer.
4. **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the prepared dataset using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

### Infrastructure Setup

1. **Database Connection**: Connects to MySQL and creates necessary tables.
2. **User Authentication**: Handles sign-up, login, and password reset with bcrypt-secured passwords.
3. **Model Loading**: Loads the fine-tuned GPT-2 model and tokenizer from Hugging Face, using GPU if available.
4. **Text Generation**: Allows users to input text and generate responses with customizable parameters.
5. **Session Management**: Maintains session states for sign-up success, login status, and current page.
6. **UI Elements**: Utilizes Streamlit’s layout features for an interactive and appealing interface, including disclaimers and guidelines.
7. **Deploy Application:** Run the Streamlit application using Hugging Face Spaces.
8. **Security:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
